  I couldn't find any source for this link, but given the HTTP headers, it seems that it is still in force.

  Also found here: [Dedicated server files at nadeo-download.cdn.ubi.com](https://nadeo-download.cdn.ubi.com/trackmania/TrackmaniaServer_Latest.zip)

  This link is coming from the new Ubisoft community forum at ["Latest dedicated server" from MrDarrek](https://discussions.ubisoft.com/topic/163322/latest-dedicated-server?lang=en-US)

  Note that the link to the [Maniaplanet dedicated server files](http://files.v04.maniaplanet.com/server/ManiaplanetServer_Latest.zip) looks closely to the first link here and is found on the [official documentation](https://doc.maniaplanet.com/dedicated-server/getting-started) ([archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20200518133125/https://doc.maniaplanet.com/dedicated-server/getting-started)).
